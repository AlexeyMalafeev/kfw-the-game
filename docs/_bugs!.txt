- l for slideshow doesn't work
- multiple attempts for defeating beggars?

- tier I move at level 20

- pre-fight: no quotes from opponent
- no ASCII for Charging Step
- Critical, then evade
- exp bonuses don't work? don't register in statistics (gossip) 
- fix scheduling for shock etc. (make immediate rescheduling)
- miscalculating exp with weapons
- Fat Girl - no help from friends
- At lv. 10 six moves to choose from - why though?
- Bagua Zhang gets low exp for impro weapons
- AI: come forward if + or if d=4 and opponent has 4-range attack
- AI: come forward more if group advantage
- remove Step Forward and Step Back when distance is not right
- multiple strength-based dam in one strike in some auto-generated moves
- when fights break out between school (not players'), show which school won
- give at least some moves with bonus when choosing new moves
- do_shock_move, try_shock_move in one move -> extra shock status?
- status attacks are level-dependent
- wrong ASCII: stunned when lying (e.g. very strong Finishing Kick), KO when lying
