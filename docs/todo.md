late game could focus more on own school development:
* choose actual style techs (from what techniques you know as a master)
* students participate in tournaments, etc. (and maybe collect stats + new accomplishments?)
* large event when all schools fight in a mega-tournament (could be all fighters or just top 3 from each school, possibly also the masters)
* maybe move school creation and challenging your master to lv 10?
* encounters and stories connected with running your school, gaining recognition, etc. Could be fun.
* a quest to unite all schools, a new type of victory (make a kung-fu federation or sth)

fix:
* double knockback!
* wrong improvised weapon

fight mechanics:
* rage - fixed chance, higher for thugs, taunts can increase, keep only step/rush forward and strikes
* fury â€“ when hp low, increase atk_pwr & to_hit
* catch breath & others restore stam relatively ?
* drunken
* grappling state, then grabs will also work (like preemptive, but different); grappling is dependent on relative strength / agility
* Stances: change tactics, always a trade-off except for the hidden ones (speed vs stamina, speed vs dfs, dfs vs atk, dfs vs mobility, preemptive vs dfs)

AI:
* style-specific AI retraining pipeline

balance:
* evolutionary algorithm for balancing boosts
