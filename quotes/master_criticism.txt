All students with style must learn how to fall.
Always getting thrashed.
Am I not teaching you right?..
Bah! Now stand up and go back to practice!
Come on, get up.
Disgraceful!
Get up! Do Horse Stance for five hours.
I have seen a lot of things in these past 70 years, but not something as miserable.
I said a proper stance, not a puppy stance!
I'm surrounded by imbeciles!
In training, you must use your brains as well.
No, I'm not like young men today. None of you can fight.
Practice diligently, master each technique...
Practicing your kung-fu upside down, huh?
Surely you can do better than this.
There isn't any power in your wrist. How do you expect to make progress?
Too many stances.
What's wrong? Weak wrists?
Worthless...
You should do more breathing exercises.
Your wrists seem to be very weak.
