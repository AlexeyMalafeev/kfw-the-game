A monkey would die under the strain.
Boring wrist exercises. How could I win with that?
Breaking my back is what this will do.
Even my shoes ache!
I can't go on...
I don't wanna die yet!
I feel very tired.
I'll be crippled for life!
It hurts!
It's killing me!
It's so painful!
Let me go. You'll break my neck!
Master!
My hands ache!
My wrists are broken!
Oh, Master, it gives me a headache now.
Oh, my hands!
That's enough, please!
That's enough. I'm dying.
You'd break a gorilla in half.
You're choking me!
