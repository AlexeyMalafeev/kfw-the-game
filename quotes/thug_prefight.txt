(He's good. Could he be the Iron Monkey?)
A real hero would show himself, or do you prefer humiliation?
After I'm through with you, you'll really be dumb!
Are you a damn masochist...
Are you ready to meet your death yet?
Are you scared?
Bastard!
Come back! We're not done yet!
Come here!
Come on, boy. This is serious.
Coming here, looking for punishment?
Damn it all! I'll give you hell!
Damn it!
Damn you!
Don't act so innocent.
Don't kid me now!
Down on your knees!
Dumb ass!
Even if the Heavens spare your life, I won't.
Get out of here.
Go away. This is not your business.
Go home, rascal!
Go to hell!
Good! Don't move.
He's not even a worm. He's too small to fight.
Hit until he gets the cramps!
Hit you till you go dizzy!
I just want your life!
I pick who I'm gonna bury next.
I shall have your teeth now!
I think you better dig your own grave!
I want to exterminate you once and for all!
I want to skin you alive!
I won't stop until you sink in hellfire!
I'll beat you up.
I'll break your bones!
I'll end you!
I'll knock out all your teeth!
I'll loosen your teeth!
I'll see you in hell!
I'll teach you a lesson, boy.
I'll tear you apart!
I'll trash you to death!
I'm going to kick you into the shadows.
I'm going to teach you a lesson.
I'm not kidding.
Is that so, now?
It's not that you won't run! You can't run!
It's you again.
Just how much is your life worth?
Let me handle your funeral!
...Not before I put you in the ground.
Now that you've had your say, I'll finish you off.
Now we're going to have some fun.
Now, don't move.
Rascal!
Right, little fart.
Say your prayers fast, 'cause you're about to get it.
Scared?
Scared, are you?
Seems bad luck follows you around.
So you must die.
So you're funny, huh?
Stand still!
Stay where you are!
Stop your pretense! Who exactly are you?
Straight to hell!
Today you die!
That's my business!
Then give up now.
Think you're real smart, huh?
This game is over. You will never escape me.
This guy is asking for trouble.
This is no joking matter!
This should be good.
To kill a nobody like you? No.
Today is the day you die!
Trying to run? Come back!
What a bastard!
What are you doing here?
What are you laughing at?
What are you looking at?
What are you so happy about?
What did you say?
What do you care?
What do you want?
What?
Who are you?
Whoever insulted me pays with his life.
Why, you...
Yes! I've got to kill this devil.
You are boring. Die.
You can't get away though.
You crazy fool! Causing trouble everywhere!
You dare to interfere in our business?
You idiot!
You know, I feel real sorry for you. Chicken, chicken!
You like to pretend that you're a real tiger, do you?
You make me sick!
You must be tired of living!
You must realize I'm paid to kill. The contract's sealed.
You rascal!
You vermin from hell! I'll beat you to death!
You watch out, or you'll have a body with no ass!
You won't be so tough after I finish with you!
You won't reach old age.
You!
You'll be crippled for life.
You're a nobody. I'll beat you up.
You're at Death's door!
You're at the end of your road!
You're done hanging around here, you bum. Keep moving your ass.
You're righteous?
You, you...
You...
