...
A strong man sheds blood before he sheds tears.
A tiger doesn't pounce on supine prey.
Admit defeat?
Ain't never looked for trouble, but always made my stand.
All too easy.
All you have to do is to use your hands.
Amazing!
And I go chop, chop, chop!
And now legs in the air just like a dead chicken!
And two becomes four!
And you said you'd put me down in three.
Are you still itching?
Aren't you ashamed of your evil deeds?
At least I don't show off my butt.
Beat you!
Bet you'd never guess that that's how you'd end up...
Can I go now?
Conquer the unyielding with the yielding!
Do you admit defeat?
Don't ever follow me again in the future!
Don't take things too seriously, and you will always be at ease.
Don't think. Feel.
Easy!
Everything Clan?
Everything is connected.
Everything's fair in love and war!
Extraordinary.
For the martial arts spirit!
Having trouble standing?
He's the "Great Bear" but he's anything but great!
Hell is empty and all devils are here.
I am no ordinary mortal.
I broke a sweat.
I chop-chop-chop this meat.
I did it! Good.
I did tell you to take it easy.
I didn't break a sweat.
I don't find it amusing, I'm afraid.
I guess I wish it was different, but a wish is only a wish.
I have already given you enough face!
I have no intention of killing you...
I hurt people without taking life.
I learn from my mistakes.
I must save Mikasa and Armin! Wait... Whose memories are these?
I seem to have pulled a muscle in my neck.
I think you've had it! You're out of breath!
I told you I got style.
I used soft style in a hard way!
I win again!
I'll let you go this time but don't do it again.
I'll let you off this time.
I'm lucky to be alive!
I'm sorry!!
I've never met a single man yet that I could call my friend.
I've no time to waste.
I've tried to teach you, but no.
If you had shown any guts I might have let you off.
In the end we will all get just what we deserve.
In this world of guns and knives, I'm gonna need luck wherever I go...
Is that it?
It looks real enough, yet it isn't.
It seems to me I was born to be a kung-fu fighting man.
It was easy.
It was too easy.
Just leave me be and you'll live to see the dawn of another day.
Justice will prevail!
Justice will prevail! Just kidding.
Let me see if you're still ferocious.
Life is a gift... for those who know how to use it.
Listen... with your nose.
My kung-fu improves every hour, soon I will be invincible.
My kung-fu is pretty good.
My master would be proud.
My only judge is me.
Not bad!
Not everyone is as dumb as you.
Nothing in life remains the same.
Now you're a broken egg!
Okay. Not bad.
One's head will never be faster than a pair of hands.
Poison against poison. It's a brilliant treatment.
Rest a while.
Smelly!
So if you see me coming, you better not step in my way.
Someday I'll stop my roaming, someday I'll find a home.
Someone's hurting!
Stars have been my blanket, grass has been my bed, and sorrow has been the pillow where I laid my weary head.
That was only your first lesson.
That's enough! I'll go home to eat.
That's horrible.
The Iron Monkey really exists.
The basis is to use your brains together with your strength.
The end is the beginning, and the beginning is the end.
The fact that you're pretending to lose lets you win.
The secret to winning a duel is to not protect your head.
The upside down stance!
This heart that pounds like a hammer, this heart that pounds so strong, this heart that pumps a great warrior's blood, this heart will pound for half as long!
This lonely life has been my wife, baby, for far too long.
This road that I've been walking don't seem to have no end.
This technique is called the Bastard's Somersault.
This was for the Iron Way.
This was for the Shaolin Temple.
Tick Tack. Tick Tack.
Train hard but never use kung-fu to bully others!
We're not free in what we do, because we're not free in what we want.
We're wanderers in the darkness.
What if everything that came from the past was influenced by the future?
What we know is a drop. What we don't know is an ocean.
Who was that fellow?
Why did you get down so fast?
Why don't you answer me?
You almost killed me!
You don't know what's good for you!
You hate me telling lies, you hate me telling the truth too, it's really difficult to serve you!
You have offended the Iron Way.
You have offended the Shaolin Temple.
You must look for a proper job.
You picked the wrong person to mess with.
You scared me then.
You slippery fellow!
You stupid fellow!
You sure can jump.
You will need medicine.
You're a big guy with a small brain.
You're a fake.
You're only slightly injured!
You're really weak against stronger people, huh.
You've got strength in your arms, but you've brains of straw.
You've pushed me too far.
