...
A strong man sheds blood before he sheds tears.
Admit defeat?
All you have to do is to use your hands.
Amazing!
And I go chop, chop, chop!
And now legs in the air just like a dead chicken!
And two becomes four!
And you said you'd put me down in three.
Aren't you ashamed of your evil deeds?
Are you alright?
Are you hurt?
Are you still itching?
At least I don't show off my butt.
Beat you!
Be careful.
Bet you'd never guess that that's how you'd end up...
But now you're a broken egg!
Can I go now?
Comfortable?
Conquer the unyielding with the yielding!
Do you admit defeat?
Don't ever follow me again in the future!
Don't take things too seriously, and you will always be at ease.
Don't think. Feel.
Easy!
End!
Enough.
Everything Clan?
Everything's fair in love and war!
Extraordinary.
Feels great.
For the martial arts spirit!
Goodbye.
Having trouble standing?
He's the "Great Bear" but he's anything but great!
I chop-chop-chop this meat.
I did it! Good.
I did tell you to take it easy.
I don't find it amusing, I'm afraid.
I don't know how...
I guess I wish it was different, but a wish is only a wish.
I have already given you enough face!
I have no intention of killing you...
I hurt people without taking life.
I must save Mikasa and Armin! Wait... Whose memories are these?
I seem to have pulled a muscle in my neck.
I think you've had it! You're out of breath!
I told you I got style.
I used soft style in a hard way!
I win again!
I'll let you go this time but don't do it again.
I'm lucky to be alive!
I'm sorry!!
I've no time to waste.
I've tried to teach you, but no.
In this world of guns and knives, I'm gonna need luck wherever I go...
Is that it?
It looks real enough, yet it isn't.
It's scary!
Justice will prevail!
Listen... with your nose.
Lucky?
My kung-fu is pretty good.
My kung-fu improves every hour, soon I will be invincible.
My master would be proud.
Naturally!
Nice?
Not bad!
Not everyone is as dumb as you.
Nothing in life remains the same.
OK, take care.
Okay. Not bad.
One's head will never be faster than a pair of hands.
Painful?
Poison against poison. It's a brilliant treatment.
Rest a while.
Smelly!
Someone's hurting!
Stop hitting me!
Success!
That was only your first lesson.
That's enough! I'll go home to eat.
That's enough.
That's horrible.
The Iron Monkey really exists.
The basis is to use your brains together with your strength.
The fact that you're pretending to lose lets you win.
The secret to winning a duel is to not protect your head.
The upside down stance.
This technique is called the Bastard's Somersault.
This was for the Iron Way.
Train hard but never use kung-fu to bully others!
Turn and escape!
Who was that fellow?
Why did you get down so fast?
Why did you trick me?
Why don't you answer me?
You almost killed me!
You don't know what's good for you!
You hate me telling lies, you hate me telling the truth too, it's really difficult to serve you!
You have offended the Shaolin Temple.
You must look for a proper job.
You picked the wrong person to mess with.
You scared me then.
You slippery fellow!
You stupid fellow!
You sure can jump.
You will need medicine.
You're a big guy with a small brain.
You're a fake.
You're only slightly injured!
You're really weak against stronger people, huh.
You've got strength in your arms, but you've brains of straw.
You've pushed me too far.
This road that I've been walking don't seem to have no end.
And I've never met a single man yet that I could call my friend.
Ain't never looked for trouble, but always made my stand.
It seems to me I was born to be a kung-fu fighting man.
Stars have been my blanket, grass has been my bed, and sorrow has been the pillow where I laid my weary head.
So if you see me coming, you better not step in my way.
Just leave me be and you'll live to see the dawn of another day.
Someday I'll stop my roaming, someday I'll find a home.
This lonely life has been my wife, baby, for far too long.
