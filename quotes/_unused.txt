"Even if I were willing, there's another who won't agree. You'll have to ask him." "And who is that, good valiant?" "This sword in my hand!"
Although not born on the same day we would on the same day die
Death wouldn't scare me, to say nothing of a few piddling bandit chiefs
Don't be taken in by this varlet's talk
Even if I gave my life I could never repay your benevolence
He's an experienced crook, the scabby donkey.
He's played us dirty!
I'm going to throw a scare into those oafs!
If there's any way I can be of service, you have only to speak
It's only my respect for you that stops me from lambasting those scabby donkeys!
Meeting a man of fame is better than just hearing his name
Of all the thirty-six ways to get out of trouble, the best way is--leave!
The astute spare the astute, and the brave know the brave
This man represents a star in Heaven. His heart is honest.
To a true man, one tells the truth

When I was on Mount Wutai I learned the Buddhist Laws of Logic from the abbot. Now I can talk a man around even if he's hard as iron.
When I'm one-tenth drunk I can use only one-tenth of my skill, but when I'm ten-tenths drunk I'm at the top of my form.
Within the four seas, all men are brothers
You ragamuffins! Did you think you could fool me? How could pricks like you ever hope to make sport of me?
