1, 2, 3... kick!	1					
A big mouth on a wet ass.					1	1
A real hero would show himself, or do you prefer humiliation?					1	
A real man never goes back on his word.	1	1	1	1		
A strong man sheds blood before he sheds tears.	1	1				
A tiger doesn't pounce on supine prey.		1				
Admit defeat?		1		1		
After I'm through with you, you'll really be dumb!					1	
Again...	1				1	
Again?	1				1	
Ain't never looked for trouble, but always made my stand.		1				
All right.	1		1		1	
All that kung-fu. Looks like dancing.					1	1
All too easy.		1		1		1
All you have to do is to use your hands.		1				
Amazing!		1		1		
And I go chop, chop, chop!	1	1				
And I'm going to see that you don't do whatever it is that you are doing!	1					
And I've never met a single man yet that I could call my friend.		1				
And now legs in the air just like a dead chicken!		1		1		1
And you said you'd put me down in three.		1		1		1
Another new stance? What is it?			1		1	
Are you a damn masochist...					1	1
Are you angry?	1	1				
Are you ready to meet your death yet?					1	
Are you scared?					1	
Are you still itching?		1				
Are you sure?	1		1		1	
Are you that good?			1		1	
Aren't you ashamed of your evil deeds?	1	1				
At least I don't show off my butt.		1		1		
Attack!	1		1		1	
Bastard!					1	1
Be careful.	1		1		1	
Beat you!		1		1		1
Bet you'd never guess that that's how you'd end up...		1				1
But killing me, you won't find that so easy.	1					
Bwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!					1	1
Can I go now?		1		1		
Come at me, if you have the nerve!	1		1		1	
Come back! We're not done yet!					1	
Come here!					1	
Come on, boy. This is serious.			1		1	
Come on, then!	1		1			
Come out and settle this once and for all!	1		1			
Coming here, looking for punishment?					1	1
Conquer the unyielding with the yielding!	1	1				
Crawl between my legs! Crawl!						1
Crawl!						1
Damn it all! I'll give you hell!					1	
Damn it!					1	
Damn you!					1	1
Darned idiot.						1
Death doesn't scare me.	1		1		1	
Did you really quit so easily?		1		1		1
Did you think you could fool me?		1		1		1
Did you think you're God's gift to kung-fu?				1		1
Dirty unflogged scoundrel! I'll teach you to know me!			1		1	
Do you admit defeat?		1		1		
Does it hurt? I'll KILL you next time!						1
Don't act so innocent.	1				1	
Don't be scared!	1		1			
Don't be so sure of yourself.	1		1		1	
Don't ever follow me again in the future!		1				1
Don't give me any more problems.		1				1
Don't hang around here if you want to live.					1	
Don't kid me now!	1		1		1	
Don't push me too far. You'll force me to retaliate!	1		1			
Don't take things too seriously, and you will always be at ease.		1		1		
Don't think you can play me.					1	1
Don't think. Feel.	1	1				
Down on your knees!					1	1
Dumb ass!					1	1
Easy!	1	1	1	1		
Enough of idle chatter!	1		1		1	
Enough!	1	1	1	1	1	1
Enough.	1	1	1	1	1	1
Even if surrounded by an army of thousands, I could hack my way out. What do you amount to!					1	
Even if the Heavens spare your life, I won't.					1	
Even if you were to study for 20 years, you wouldn't beat me.	1	1	1	1		
Everything Clan?		1				
Everything is connected.		1				
Everything's fair in love and war!	1	1	1	1		
Extraordinary.		1		1		
Fate has brought us together in this barren land.	1		1			
For the Iron Way!	1	1	1	1		
For the martial arts spirit!	1	1	1	1		
For training, I'm willing to endure anything.	1	1				
Fortunately, I came in the nick of time!	1	1				
Get lost! You're in my way.			1	1	1	1
Get out of here.			1	1	1	1
Get up!						1
Go ahead!	1		1		1	
Go away. This is not your business.					1	
Go back where you came from, quickly, if you want to save yourself a beating.	1					
Go home, rascal!					1	
Go to hell!	1		1		1	
Good moves...		1		1		
Good! Don't move.					1	
Good! Fight!	1		1			
Good. Very good.		1		1		
Gotta keep myself strong and fat.	1	1	1	1		
Ha!		1		1		1
Had enough?		1		1		1
Have a few strokes!	1		1			
Haven't you heard of me? Where do you get the gall to come and tweak the tiger's whiskers?	1		1		1	
Having trouble standing?		1		1		1
He who can only strike what he sees is a second-rate martial artist. Do not underestimate me.	1		1			
Hell is empty and all devils are here.	1	1				
Here comes an earthquake!	1		1			
Here I come!	1		1			
Here I come! Winds sweep the plum flowers!	1		1			
Here, bite this.	1		1			
Here, eat this.	1		1			
Here, just taste that.	1		1			
He's good. Could he be the Iron Monkey?					1	
He's huge and fierce...	1					
He's not even a worm. He's too small to fight.					1	
He's quite big...	1					
He's small! Should be easy!	1					
"He's the ""Great Bear"" but he's anything but great!"		1				
Hey there. Get going now.			1			
Hey, friend. Not bad style.	1		1			
Hey, hold it.	1		1		1	
Hit all you want!	1					
Hit until he gets the cramps!					1	
Hit you like a dog!						1
Hit you till you go dizzy!					1	
Hmm!	1	1	1	1		
Hmm! It's nothing special.		1		1		
Hmm! You were lucky to survive, but a smarter man would have stayed away.						1
Hmm?	1		1		1	
Honestly, I'm not that weak!	1	1	1	1		
How about a little kiss?	1					
How could you slander an honest man?	1					
How dare you hit me?		1		1		1
How dare you talk back?					1	
How does that feel?				1		1
Huh?			1	1	1	1
Hurry, I'm a very busy man.	1		1			
I am here to win. That's all.	1		1			
I am no ordinary mortal.		1		1		
I bet you this will tickle.	1		1			
I broke a sweat.		1		1		
I call this my Shrimp Fist, I designed it to beat idiots like you.	1					
I can do it!	1					
I can handle you all by myself.	1					
I can stand almost anything, you bum!	1		1			
I chop-chop-chop this meat.		1				
I did it! Good.		1		1		
I did tell you to take it easy.		1		1		
I didn't break a sweat.		1		1		
I didn't hit her. I did NOT.	1					
I don't find it amusing, I'm afraid.	1	1	1	1		
I don't want any trouble.	1					
I guess I haven't got much choice...	1					
I guess I wish it was different, but a wish is only a wish.		1				
I hate evil!	1	1				
I have already given you enough face!	1	1				
I have no intention of killing you...	1	1	1	1		
I hop, I step and I jump!	1					
I hurt people without taking life.		1		1		
I just want your life!					1	
I learn from my mistakes.		1				
I must get my second wind...	1					
I must save Mikasa and Armin! Wait... Whose memories are these?	1	1				
I pick who I'm gonna bury next.					1	
I see that you come from Japan.	1	1				
I seem to have pulled a muscle in my neck.		1		1		
I shall have your teeth now!					1	
I suppose I should warn you.	1		1			
I think you better dig your own grave!					1	
I think you've got next to nothing.			1	1		
I think you've had it! You're out of breath!		1		1		
I told you I got style.		1				
I used soft style in a hard way!		1				
I want to exterminate you once and for all!					1	
I want to skin you alive!					1	
I want to test your instinct and reflexes!	1					
I want to try something...	1					
I will defeat you for love.	1					
I win again!		1		1		
I won't even need my hands for you, stupid.	1		1			
I won't run!	1					
I won't stop until you sink in hellfire!			1		1	
I'd like to pay my respects to you.		1		1		
If I break your hand or foot you'll have brought it on yourself.	1		1			
If I can't beat you down, I'll give up martial arts.	1		1			
If this goes on, I'll make a fool of myself.	1	1				
If you don't behave, I'll hit you!	1		1			
If you don't behave, I'll really hit you!	1		1			
If you had shown any guts I might have let you off.				1		1
If you have any sense, shell out and buy yourself a free passage!					1	
If you wish to learn, your humble servant can give you a few pointers.	1		1			
I'll beat you up.	1		1		1	
I'll break your bones!					1	
I'll end you!					1	
I'll fight you, even if it kills me!	1					
I'll finish you in just three attacks!	1		1			
I'll have to teach you a lesson!	1		1		1	
I'll knock out all your teeth!					1	
I'll let you go this time but don't do it again.		1				
I'll let you grow into someone worth killing.						1
I'll let you off this time.		1		1		1
I'll loosen your teeth!					1	
I'll see you in hell!					1	
I'll settle with you!					1	
I'll show you excellence!	1		1			
I'll show you once!	1		1			
I'll spare your life.						1
I'll strike the vital points!	1		1			
I'll strip the lout of your clothes and sell them for wine money.					1	
I'll teach you a lesson, boy.			1		1	
I'll tear you apart!					1	
I'll trash you to death!					1	
I'll try out my new technique.	1		1			
I'm a killer of pigs!	1	1				
I'm afraid you are making a mistake.	1					
I'm as good as dead!	1					
I'm bullying you if I fight.	1		1			
I'm Chief Fox. You're under arrest.	1	1				
I'm going to kick you into the shadows.			1		1	
I'm going to teach you a lesson.	1		1		1	
I'm going to teach you a new technique!			1			
I'm gonna fix you!			1		1	
I'm here.	1					
I'm lucky to be alive!		1				
I'm not kidding.	1		1		1	
I'm not scared!	1					
I'm now going to demonstrate.	1		1			
I'm only scared of my Grandpa!	1					
I'm real scared!	1		1		1	
I'm sorry!!		1		1		
I'm warning you, you're going to hurt yourself.	1		1			
Impossible!	1	1				
In the end we will all get just what we deserve.		1		1		
In this world of guns and knives, I'm gonna need luck wherever I go...	1	1				
Iron Monkey!	1	1				
Is it ethical?	1	1				
Is that it?	1	1	1	1	1	1
Is that so, now?			1		1	
Is there no other way?	1					
Isn't that disgraceful?		1		1		
It looks real enough, yet it isn't.	1	1				
It seems to me I was born to be a kung-fu fighting man.	1	1				
It sure has brightened the day I met you.	1	1				
It was easy.		1		1		
It was too easy.		1		1		1
It's easy!	1		1			
It's footwork, all right.		1		1		
It's just your bad luck that you have run into me.	1		1		1	
It's not that simple!	1					
It's not that you won't run! You can't run!					1	
It's tearing me apart!	1	1				
It's you again.	1		1		1	
I've come to dig your grave.	1					
I've never met a single man yet that I could call my friend.	1	1				
I've no time to lose.	1	1	1	1		
I've no time to waste.	1	1	1	1		
I've tried to teach you, but no.		1				
Joy, sadness, melancholy, happiness!	1					
Judging by you, your master's kung-fu stinks.				1		1
Just how much is your life worth?					1	1
Just leave me be and you'll live to see the dawn of another day.	1	1				
Just watch...	1		1			
Just you wait and see!	1		1			
Justice will prevail!	1	1				
Justice will prevail! Just kidding.	1	1				
Left, right, the fairy strews the flowers!	1	1				
Let me handle your funeral!					1	
Let me see if you're still ferocious.		1				
Let me see if you're still vicious!		1				
Let me see what this is all about.	1		1			
Let me show you...	1		1			
Let me teach this low life a lesson!	1		1			
Let them cut your flesh so you can kick their ass	1	1				
Let's duel again! Some time later.		1		1		
Let's end this.	1		1			
Let's end this here and now.	1		1			
Let's get started.	1		1		1	
Let's have a little fun!	1		1		1	
Let's see it then.	1		1			
Let's see you block this!	1		1		1	
Let's stay civil, shall we?	1					
Life is a gift... for those who know how to use it.		1		1		
Listen... with your nose.	1	1				
Look, right foot.	1					
Looks like a sure win to me.	1		1			
Me kill a nobody like you? No.						1
Mind your head!	1	1				
My forehead is strong, my forehead is ready.	1					
My kung-fu improves every hour, soon I will be invincible.	1	1				
My kung-fu is pretty good.	1	1	1	1		
My master would be proud.		1		1		
My only judge is me.		1				
Next time don't even think about messing with me.		1		1		1
Next time I see you, I shall take you apart.						1
No holding back!	1		1			
No way!	1	1				
None of you is my equal.	1	1				
Not bad!		1		1		
Not before I put you in the ground!					1	
Not everyone is as dumb as you.	1	1				
Not that easy!	1					
Nothing in life remains the same.		1				
Nothing's been going right today, so you caught me in a bad mood.	1	1				
Now let's start!	1		1			
Now that you've had your say, I'll finish you off.					1	
Now we're going to have some fun.			1		1	
Now you hit me. I promise I won't fight back. ...Just kidding!	1					
Now you're a broken egg!		1				
Now, don't move.					1	
Oh, boy!	1	1				
Oh, dear.	1	1				
Oh, no, you don't!	1					
Oh, now we'll really have fun.	1				1	
OK, a little force may help...	1					
OK, I'll see what mischief you're up to!	1					
Okay. Not bad.		1		1		
One at a time.	1					
One's head will never be faster than a pair of hands.		1				
Pathetic!		1		1		1
Patience!	1					
Pay your respects to me then!		1				1
People might very well call me Lord of the West.	1	1				
Place your bets!	1					
Play on the opponent's emotions...	1	1				
Playing dead, eh? I'll hit you a few more!						1
Poison against poison. It's a brilliant treatment.		1				
Rascal!	1	1	1	1	1	1
Ready or not, here I come!	1					
Ready to learn?	1		1			
Ready?	1		1			
Repent!	1	1	1	1		
Rest a while.		1		1		
Right, little fart.					1	
Right. Come on!	1		1			
Rot!					1	1
Run for your life!					1	1
Say your prayers fast, 'cause you're about to get it.					1	
Scared, are you?	1		1		1	
Scared?	1		1		1	
See how obedient he is!						1
Seems bad luck follows you around.					1	
Shaolin punks.						1
Smelly!	1	1				
So if you see me coming, you better not step in my way.	1	1				
So that's how it is, huh?	1	1	1	1		
So that's it. You mean to say my kung-fu is lousy?	1		1			
So what?	1	1	1	1		
So you know kung-fu as well?	1	1	1	1		
So you must die.					1	
So you want to beat me? I'll smash you!			1		1	
So you want to play at kung-fu.			1	1		
So you're funny, huh?			1		1	
So, I'm unlucky today.	1					
Someday I'll stop my roaming, someday I'll find a home.	1	1				
Someone's hurting!		1				
Stand still!					1	
Stars have been my blanket, grass has been my bed, and sorrow has been the pillow where I laid my weary head.	1	1				
Stay where you are!					1	
Still laughing?				1		1
Still won't give up?				1		1
Stop that. Stop that...	1					
Stop your nonsense. Start!	1		1			
Stop your pretense! Who exactly are you?			1		1	
Stop!	1					
Straight to hell!					1	1
Strike all the way!	1		1			
Tell me your name, if you have one.			1		1	
Ten strokes should be enough.	1		1			
Ten strokes won't be needed. I'm gonna do it in three.	1		1			
Test your eyes against my hands...	1		1			
That scabby donkey is no good.	1	1	1	1		
That should teach you not to mess with me.		1		1		1
That was only your first lesson.		1		1		1
That won't be easy...	1					
That won't be necessary. You'll see.	1					
That'll teach ya!		1		1		1
That's enough! I'll go home to eat.		1				
That's enough.	1	1	1	1	1	1
That's horrible.	1	1				
That's my business!					1	
That's what you call excellence?		1		1		
The basis is to use your brains together with your strength.	1	1	1	1		
The crocodile hits the boat!	1	1				
The dragon's tail is right here!	1	1				
The end is the beginning, and the beginning is the end.	1	1				
The fact that you're pretending to lose lets you win.		1				
The iron bull ploughs!	1	1				
The Iron Monkey really exists.		1				
The lion shakes its head and here comes the end!	1	1				
The secret to winning a duel is to not protect your head.	1	1				
The truly strong need no techniques	1	1	1	1		
The upside down stance!		1				
Then give up now.	1		1		1	
There's no other way.	1		1			
There's nothing I can do to avoid this fight.	1					
There's nothing I can do to clear up this misunderstanding...	1					
There's power inside to kill.	1	1				
Think you're real smart, huh?			1	1	1	1
This game is over. You will never escape me.					1	
This guy is asking for trouble.			1		1	
This heart that pounds like a hammer, this heart that pounds so strong, this heart that pumps a great warrior's blood, this heart will pound for half as long!	1	1				
This is as far as you'll go.	1	1	1	1		
This is no joking matter!	1	1				
This is preposterous!	1	1	1	1		
This is what happens if you mess with me!				1		1
This lonely life has been my wife, baby, for far too long.	1	1				
This road that I've been walking don't seem to have no end.	1	1				
This seems like fun.	1		1			
This should be good.	1		1		1	
This style's meant for women, isn't it?			1		1	
This technique is called the Bastard's Somersault.		1				
This time I won't hold back.	1		1			
This time it's for real!	1		1			
This was for the Iron Way.		1		1		
This was for the Shaolin Temple.		1		1		
Tick Tack. Tick Tack.	1	1				
To kill a nobody like you? No.					1	1
Today I have an opponent that's worthy.	1		1			
Today is the day you die!					1	
Today you die!					1	
Train hard but never use kung-fu to bully others!		1		1		
Try this!	1		1			
Trying to run? Come back!			1		1	
Twist and turn!	1	1				
Unbelievable...	1	1				
Useless bum!			1	1	1	1
Wait!	1				1	
Wait, what?	1					
Watch carefully!	1		1			
Watch this!	1					
Watch this.	1					
Watch. This.	1					
Well, had enough?		1		1		
Well, I'll show you what a tiger's about.	1		1			
Well, it leaves me no alternative then.	1		1			
Well, let's see.	1		1		1	
Well, now, what's that supposed to be?	1		1		1	
We're not free in what we do, because we're not free in what we want.	1	1				
We're wanderers in the darkness.	1	1				
What a bastard!					1	1
What am I supposed to do now?	1	1				
What are you doing here?					1	
What are you laughing at?					1	
What are you looking at?					1	
What are you making such a blasted racket about?					1	
What are you so happy about?					1	
What are you up to?	1		1			
What did you say?			1		1	
What do you care?					1	
What do you mean by coming here?					1	1
What do you want?					1	
What if everything that came from the past was influenced by the future?	1	1				
What is it?	1		1		1	
What is this tomfoolery?	1					
What punishment is appropriate?	1		1			
What rotten luck!	1	1				
What we know is a drop. What we don't know is an ocean.	1	1				
What?	1	1	1	1	1	1
What's going on?	1					
What's this?	1	1				
What's up?	1					
What's wrong? Can't get up, huh?				1		1
What's your hurry?			1		1	
When enemies meet, their eyes blaze.	1					
Where is that scabby donkey?						1
Where there's a will, there's a way!	1	1				
Where's your kung-fu?				1		1
Who are you?	1		1		1	
Who are you? I haven't met you before. Why do you want to kill me?	1					
Who was that fellow?		1		1		1
Whoever insulted me pays with his life.			1		1	
Why are you so sad?	1					
Why did you get down so fast?		1		1		
Why don't you answer me?		1				
Why don't you start to jump!	1					
Why, you...			1		1	
Why?	1	1				
Within the four seas, all men are brothers	1	1				
Would the tiger devour the elephant? Or would the elephant trample the tiger?	1					
Would you like to try it?	1		1			
Yes! I've got to kill this devil.					1	
You almost killed me!		1				
You are boring. Die.					1	
You are much weaker than I thought.				1		1
You are no match for my technique!	1	1		1		
You are too much!	1	1				
You call that kung-fu? Who taught you that?			1	1		
You can study kung-fu for 20 years if you want... but you will never beat me.			1	1		
You can't best the righteous!	1	1				
You can't get away though.					1	
You crazy fool! Causing trouble everywhere!					1	
You dare to interfere in our business?					1	
You don't have to do that.	1					
You don't know what's good for you!	1	1				
You fight quite well. I must give you credit.				1		
You hate me telling lies, you hate me telling the truth too, it's really difficult to serve you!		1				
You have offended the Iron Way.	1	1				
You have offended the Shaolin Temple.	1	1				
You idiot!			1	1	1	1
You insist on fighting?	1					
You know, I feel real sorry for you. Chicken, chicken!					1	1
You like to pretend that you're a real tiger, do you?					1	1
You lousy swine!					1	1
You make me sick!					1	1
You must be cautious.	1	1				
You must be strong!	1
