...
All right.
Another new stance? What is it?
Are you that good?
Attack!
Come on, then!
Don't be scared!
Enough.
For martial arts spirit!
Get lost! You're in my way.
Good! Fight!
Have a few strokes!
Hey, friend. Not bad style.
Hey, hold it.
Hey there. Get going now.
Hmm!
Hmm?
Huh?
I can stand almost anything, you bum!
I suppose I should warn you.
I want to test your instinct and reflexes!
I'll finish you in just three attacks!
I'll have to teach you a lesson!
I'd like to pay my respects to you.
I'm going to teach you a new technique!
I'm gonna fix you!
I'm warning you, you're going to hurt yourself.
I think you've got next to nothing.
I won't even need my hands for you, stupid.
If I can't beat you down, I'll give up martial arts.
Is that it?
Judging by you, your master's kung-fu stinks.
Let's get started.
Let's have a little fun!
Let's stay civil, shall we?
Now let's start!
Ready?
Ready to learn?
So that's it. You mean to say my kung-fu is lousy?
So you know kung-fu as well?
So you want to play at kung-fu.
Stop your nonsense. Start!
Tell me your name, if you have one.
Ten strokes should be enough.
Ten strokes won't be needed. I'm gonna do it in three.
There's power inside to kill.
This style's meant for women, isn't it?
Today I have an opponent that's worthy.
Well, let's see.
You're really asking for it!
You're trying to cheat, huh?
You make me sick!
You think you're quick, huh?
