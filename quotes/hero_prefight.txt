...
1, 2, 3... kick!
A strong man sheds blood before he sheds tears.
Again...
Again?
And I go chop, chop, chop!
And I'm going to see that you don't do whatever it is that you are doing!
Are you angry?
Are you sure you want to do this?
Aren't you ashamed of your evil deeds?
Attack!
Be careful.
But killing me, you won't find that so easy.
Come on, then!
Conquer the unyielding with the yielding!
Don't be so sure of that...
Enough.
Fate has brought us together in this barren land.
For the Iron Way!
For the martial arts spirit!
For training, I'm willing to endure anything.
Fortunately, I came in the nick of time!
Go ahead!
Go to hell!
Good! Fight!
Have a few strokes!
He's huge and fierce...
He's quite big...
He's small! Should be easy!
Here I come!
Here I come! Winds sweep the plum flowers!
Here comes an earthquake!
Here, bite this.
Here, eat this.
Here, just taste that.
Hit all you want!
Hmm?
Honestly, I'm not that weak!
How about a little kiss?
Hurry, I'm a very busy man.
I bet you this will tickle.
I call this my Shrimp Fist, I designed it to beat idiots like you.
I can do it!
I can handle you all by myself.
I didn't hit her. I did NOT.
I don't want any trouble.
I guess I haven't got much choice...
I hate evil!
I have no intention of killing you...
I hop, I step and I jump!
I must get my second wind...
I see that you come from Japan.
I want to try something...
I won't run!
I'll fight you, even if it kills me!
I'll have to teach you a lesson!
I'll show you excellence!
I'll show you once!
I'll strike the vital points!
I'll try out my new technique.
I'm a killer of pigs!
I'm Chief Fox. You're under arrest.
I'm afraid you are making a mistake.
I'm as good as dead!
I'm bullying you if I fight.
I'm here.
I'm not scared!
I'm now going to demonstrate.
I'm only scared of my Grandpa!
I'm real scared!
If this goes on, I'll make a fool of myself.
If you don't behave, I'll hit you!
If you don't behave, I'll really hit you!
Impossible!
I must save Mikasa and Armin! Wait... Whose memories are these?
Iron Monkey!
Is it ethical?
Is that it?
Is there no other way?
Isn't that disgraceful?
It sure has brightened the day I met you.
It's easy!
It's not that simple!
I've come to dig your grave.
Joy, sadness, melancholy, happiness!
Just watch...
Just you wait and see!
Left, right, the fairy strews the flowers!
Let me see if you're still vicious!
Let me show you...
Let me teach this low life a lesson!
Let's get started.
Let's have a little fun!
Let's see it then.
Let's see you block this!
Let's stay civil, shall we?
Listen... with your nose.
Look, right foot.
Looks like a sure win to me.
Mind your head!
No holding back!
No way!
Not that easy!
Nothing's been going right today, so you caught me in a bad mood.
Now you hit me. I promise I won't fight back. ...Just kidding!
OK, I'll see what mischief you're up to!
OK, a little force may help...
Oh, boy!
Oh, dear.
Oh, no, you don't!
Oh, now we'll really have fun.
One at a time.
Patience!
Place your bets!
Play on the opponent's emotions...
Ready or not, here I come!
Ready?
Repent!
Right. Come on!
So what?
So, I'm unlucky today.
Stop that. Stop that...
Stop!
Strike all the way!
Test your eyes against my hands...
That won't be easy...
That won't be necessary. You'll see.
The crocodile hits the boat!
The dragon's tail is right here!
The iron bull ploughs!
The lion shakes its head and here comes the end!
There's no other way.
There's nothing I can do to avoid this fight.
There's nothing I can do to clear up this misunderstanding...
This is as far you'll go.
This seems like fun.
This time it's for real!
This time I won't hold back.
Try this!
Twist and turn!
Unbelievable...
Wait!
Wait, what?
Watch carefully!
Watch this.
Watch this!
Watch. This.
Well, I'll show you what a tiger's about.
Well, it leaves me no alternative then.
Well, now, what's that supposed to be?
What am I supposed to do now?
What are you up to?
What is it?
What is this tomfoolery?
What punishment is appropriate?
What rotten luck!
What's going on?
What's this?
What's up?
Where there's a will, there's a way!
Who are you? I haven't met you before. Why do you want to kill me?
Why are you so sad?
Why don't you start to jump!
Why?
Would you like to try it?
You are no match for my technique!
You are too much!
You can't best the righteous!
You don't have to do that.
You insist on fighting?
You lousy swine!
You make me sick!
You must be cautious.
You must be strong!
You picked the wrong person to mess with.
You should give it some careful thought.
You tricky swine!
You'll see. I'm a master now.
You're imitation stuff!
You're mad, huh?
You're so big and strong! I'm a little worried!
You're so impulsive!
You're very rude!
You've gotta see my real style.
Your techniques are so vicious! Why?
