All that kung-fu. Looks like dancing.
Did you think you're God's gift to kung-fu?
Do you admit defeat?
Enough!
Even if you were to study for 20 years, you wouldn't beat me.
Good moves...
Good. Very good.
Gotta keep myself strong and fat.
Hmm! It's nothing special.
I have no intention of killing you...
It's footwork, all right.
Let's duel again! Some time later.
That's enough.
That's what you call excellence?
That was only your first lesson.
Well, had enough?
You call that kung-fu? Who taught you that?
You can study kung-fu for 20 years if you want... but you will never beat me.
You fight quite well. I must give you credit.
You must know the importance of basics.
You need the right opponent to fight.
You need to practice more.
You see, 30% hands, 70% legs.
You sure can talk.
You're a bum.
You're a disgrace to kung-fu.
You're good. But not good enough.
You're too weak to fight me.    
You're useless.
You will never beat me.
You wouldn't know good kung-fu if it kicked you in the butt.
This road that I've been walking don't seem to have no end.
And I've never met a single man yet that I could call my friend.
Ain't never looked for trouble, but always made my stand.
It seems to me I was born to be a kung-fu fighting man.
Stars have been my blanket, grass has been my bed, and sorrow has been the pillow where I laid my weary head.
So if you see me coming, you better not step in my way.
Just leave me be and you'll live to see the dawn of another day.
Someday I'll stop my roaming, someday I'll find a home.
This lonely life has been my wife, baby, for far too long.
