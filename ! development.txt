_____________________________________________________

implement 'momentum' - a bonus to attack after Step Forward ('+') and Rush Forward ('++'), or make it a tech

generate new maneuvers (fast charging step etc.), a fixed chance at getting maneuvers when choosing new move

more complex genetic fight AI that learns not only probabilies to execute moves, but also some thresholds (e.g. do focus
    when qp < threshold etc.; also consider group advantage

train style-specific AIs

! use | in style move_s (e.g. short-range,punch|kick)
